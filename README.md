PROBLEM
When driving and listening to music, oftentimes we want to change the volume based on the speed of the vehicle. For example, when moving at higher speeds, drivers will raise the volume to better hear the music, and when stopped at a stop light, will lower the volume significantly. This issue is a clear nuisance, but can also present a major safety hazard that takes the userâ€™s concentration away from driving and to adjusting the volume, especially for drivers who do not use the car sound system. Outside of driving specifically, this is a problem for those who bike or skate with a speaker as well. 

Solution Overview
Our solution is to create a speaker that will automatically increase and decrease volume based on the speed that the speaker is moving. The speaker will be a portable Bluetooth speaker that the user can take in and out of the car. Users will also have the ability to set the minimum and maximum volumes to better personalize their listening experience. It will also contain a series of LEDs that tell the user the current volume. The speaker system will have two modes: one for when it is moving, and one for when it is stationary. When it is in the stationary mode, the user can increase and decrease volume with buttons. When it is in moving mode, the user will not be able to change the volume, so that the user focuses on driving.
